		<h3>
			<p style="max-width:800px;">
			Wheel of fortune, is a card that represents  change, luck, and fortune. It is a reminder that life is constantly changing and that the wheel of luck is always turning in circles. It reminds us that while tough days won't be forever, happy moments will also be gone in a flash which is why it is important to appreciate them while they are with us. It is also a reminder of the idea of karma, "what goes around comes around," that it is important to be kind towards others. The card appears usually when things are about to take a turn, whether for the worse or for the better, and that if opportunities come, to sieze them before they disapear.</p>

			The past week has been a blur for me, with stress and anxiety compounding. I've been feeling moments of uncertainty in my path of life, so this card serves a reminder that life is constantly moving and that while I may not see the change in front of me, it doesn't mean that it isn't happening, for better or for worse.</p>
