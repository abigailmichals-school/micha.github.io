    <div class="item item1"><p style="max-width:800px;">
			The World, is a card that represents wholeness, achievement, fufilment, and completition. It is a card that arrives when a long term project, career, relationship or other major life event has come full circle and now is the time to enjoy the sense of completition and accomplishment. The World invites you to enjoy the fruits of your labor and that it is important to take in the moment of success, as you have put in much work to reach this moment.</p>
		</div>
    <div class="item item2"><p style="max-width:800px;">
			This Card comes at a moment when it is time to celebrate your successes, and begin the next big project. It can also come at a time before the moment of success, letting the reader know that it is close and to keep their eye on the prize.</p>
		</div>
    <div class="item item3"><p style="max-width:800px;">
			This card comes at a great relief to me, as there have been several personal projects I have been working on that I hope to find success in. I also hope that this card applies to my school work, as midterms are coming up, and this year has been a bit of a struggle for me.</p>
